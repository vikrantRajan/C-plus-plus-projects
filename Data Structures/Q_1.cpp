// Specification:
// Design and Implement a C++ program that implements the following:
// • 2D Rectangle Class with floating point coordinates
// o Include methods for constructing an axis-aligned Rectangle with initial size and coordinates
// o Include a Copy constructor and an Assignment operator
// • Algorithm that checks whether or not a 2D point is contained in an axis-aligned Rectangle
// • Algorithm that checks whether or not two axis-aligned Rectangles intersect
// • Simple test code that creates instances of your class and tests your implementation
// Given:
// You can use this class in your implementation. Feel free to modify this class as well.
